1.Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a2

2.Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
000000000000000e  19ac

3.At what address is the function printf located?
  30:	00000097          	auipc	ra,0x0
  34:	610080e7          	jalr	1552(ra) = jump (0x1552+0x30)=0x1582
1582

4.What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?


5.Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72; dlr
	printf("H%x Wo%s %p\n", 57616, &i,&i);
      
5.1 What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
HE110 World
5.2 If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? 
0x00726c64
5.3 Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
no need
5.4 In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
y=1()
